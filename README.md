The above problem is based on the prediction of heart disease persons where the person contain the feartures in the dataset from the heart.csv file.
So, To predict the person contain heart disease or not I used three algorithm from supervised machine learning where In that 
1.LogisticRegression
2.DecisionTreeClassifier
3.RandomForestClassifier

In those three algorithms I got good accuracy as you can see that from the code
1.LogisticRegression-0.7824675324675324
2.DecisionTreeClassifier-0.9837662337662337
3.RandomForestClassifier-1.0

I took dataset from our favourite website kaggle.com
