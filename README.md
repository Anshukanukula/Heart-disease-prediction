The above problem is based on the prediction of heart disease persons where the person contain the feartures in the dataset from the heart.csv file.</br>
</br>
So, To predict the person contain heart disease or not I used three algorithm from supervised machine learning where In that </br>
1. LogisticRegression</br>
2. DecisionTreeClassifier</br>
3. RandomForestClassifier</br>
</br>
In those three algorithms I got good accuracy as you can see that from the code</br>
1. LogisticRegression-0.7824675324675324</br>
2. DecisionTreeClassifier-0.9837662337662337</br>
3. RandomForestClassifier-1.0</br>

I took dataset from our favourite website kaggle.com</br>
